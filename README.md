# Group 5 Mockup App:
## Len Washington III, Garbo Chan, Dulce Gomez, Alexander Garcia

Here is the mockup app that we created that shows the basics of how the MobileID app could be changed for the better.
Within [COM421 Mockup/bin/publish](/COM421 Mockup/bin/publish), you should find a folder with your system's architecture.
Download that folder, and you should be able to run the program.
If the program is not pre-built, you can build it with [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (which is what I used to build it, not sure how it will translate to Visual Studio).

Below are additional image representations that we thought might be useful:

## Errors:
If you run into an error complaining about `locations` or `locations.json`, I didn't upload that file because it's all information I took from MobileID, and I'm not sure how appropriate it is to upload.
